This is the portfolio website for The Ministry of Extraordinary affairs. It consists of a back-end consisting of two json files and a folder of images (in the data folder). Furthermore, the front-end uses:

- `react` as the basis for UI
- `react-router` for routing
- `react-spring` for movements
- `rebass`  with `emotion-theming` as a basis for the themable design and UI component system, with a lot of additional components and general design inspiration taken from GitHub primer
- `lodash` for utility functions (e.g. `merge`)



// todo
